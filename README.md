# Word-Guess-Game

### Description 
A node.js command line word guess game similar to hangman.

### Motivation
Lets users quickly play a word guess game without the need for a GUI.

### Results
This project is originally written in javascript, which is found in the /original-javascript-files directory. I then converted the project into Typescript, which is a super set of javascript that gets compiled into javascript. The Typescript source files are in the /src directory, and the compiled javascript files are located in /build/src.

### Future Improvements
* [ ] Add stricter Typescript rules

### Installation
```
git clone <Word-Guess-Game url>
cd path/to/Word-Guess-Game
npm install
```
### How to run
To run original javascript files:
```
node ./original-javascript-files/index.js
```
Or to run compiled js files:
```
node ./build/src/index.js
```
Both ways produce the same game
